	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>My name is Xiaojuan Wu. Welcome to my fun world of Business Intelligence! I love data analysis and machine learning. And I am pretty good at SQL and Tableau. Want to learn more about me?

<a href="https://github.com/">Also there are projects in my Github</a></p>
<div class="Tableau">
	<h1>Reports and Dashboards</h1>
	<p>This part is all about reports and dashboards built by Tableau. Some of the underlying SQLs can be found on my github.</p>
	<ul>

			<h5>Recommendation System</h5>
			<p>This recommendation system is an essiential part of fraud reports. The dataset only includes traffic which is suspicious, such as having
				click injection or linear patterns. This system shows the amount of each pattern, where the traffic originated from, and digs 
				to sub-levels such as countries, campaigns, sites, ect.</p>

			<h5>User Retention</h5>
			<p>User lifecycle is the important for moblile gaming apps. Getting people to download your app is the first step, What is more important is to engage, retain or even convert those users to paying users. Among all the components of user lifecycle, Retention is the most important metric for mobile gaming apps.
				There are different ways to calulate retention, and each of them servers different goals. Classic retention is the most commonly used retention type. Rolling retention also could be important if you want to see how many users are lost after certain amount of days after 
		installation.</P>
			<p><em>ALL DATA IN THE REPORT IS FROM ARTIFICAL DATASET, NO SENSITIVE INFORMATION INCLUDED</em></p>

			<h5>Re-targeting Advertisering</h5>
			<p>Unlike typical banner ads, retargeting ads are a form of online advertisering which server users who already installed apps. Awareness and conversion are the two main goals of retargeting advertisering. There are two ways to measure the performance of retargeting channels based on the goal. For the awareness, the re-targeting retention is a good way to look at how many users come back to the app after they clicked the retargeting ads and which channel serverd them. For the conversion, the retergeting revenues reports shows how much revenues generated from retargeting ads during the retargeting window by different channels. Both reports allow you to compare with different channels and give a good idea which channle drives the most users or revenues.</p>

			<h5>Traffic Quality</h5>
			<p>IVT(Invalid traffic) or ad fraud in moblile digital advertising is hurting the industry. And it is the time to fight back. Currently most of companies use a Cost model which 
				is based on clicks or installations, then fraud also happens in that part. The amount of time from clicking an ad to installation of the app is a critial indicator of traffic quality. This report compares
			how long it takes for different channels to go from ad clicking to app installation.</p>

	<h1>Machine Learning</h1>
	<p>This part includes projects I have worked on using Machine Learning algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, 
		KNN, PCA etc. This also inludes methodologyes to test the data models' accuracy.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<h5>Linear Regression and Gradient Descent</h5>
			<p>This project used linear regression to find the corralation between different features (such as the number of rooms, locations,
				etc.) and housing prices in the Boston real estate market. The dataset was split into two: training and testing datasets.
				The training dataset was used to build regression models, while the test dataset was used to measure the accuracy of the model. In addition, the gradient descent algorithm was
				was used to find the best value of beta and alpha, which helped minimize the cost function.
			<p><strong>Data Set:</strong> Boston Housing Prices</p>
			<p><strong>Data Model:</strong> Linear/Logistic Regression</p>
			<p><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Cross Validation to train the model; Gradient Descent to minimize the cost function</p>
			<p>Please check out the code from Github: <a href="https://github.com/XiaojuanWu/machineLearning_LR_gradientDescent">Gradient Descent and Regression</a></p>

		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>KNN (K-nearest neighbors) </h5>
			<p><strong>Data Set:</strong> Boston Housing Prices</p>
			<p><strong>Data Model:</strong> KNN Neast Neighbor</p>
			<p><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Cross Validation to train the model; Cost function to check the accuracy of the model</p>
			<p>Please check out the code from Github: <a href="https://github.com/XiaojuanWu/machineLearning_knn">KNN Nearest Neighbor</a></p>

		<li>
			<h5>Naive Bayes Classifier</h5>
			<p>This project used movie reviews from rotten tomatoes, and applied Naive Bayes Classifier to create a model
			which predicts a review is fresh or rotten.</p>
			<p><strong>Data Set:</strong> Movie reviews from Rotten Tomatoes</p>
			<p><strong>Data Model:</strong> Naive Bayes Classifier</p>
			<p><strong>Algorithms:</strong> NLP(Nature Language Process) to analyze reviews; PCA to find the best features</p>
			<p>Please check out the code from Github: <a href="https://github.com/XiaojuanWu/machineLearning_PCA_NLP">PCA and Natrual Language Process</a></p>
			<img src="img/sp.png"/>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>PCA and Regression</h5>
			<p>This project use the boston housing prices data and applied PCA algorithm which helps to find pattern in high dimension(12 features in this situation)
			</p>
			<p><strong>Data Set:</strong>Boston Housing Prices</p>
			<p><strong>Data Model:</strong>Regression</p>
			<p><strong>Algorithms:</strong>K-folder cross validation to train the model; PCA to find the pattern in high dimensions</p>
